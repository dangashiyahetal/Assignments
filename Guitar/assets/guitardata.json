The pick-ups and hardware are sometimes suspect, and the workmanship varies from instrument to instrument, but for the price, these are a very good beginner guitar choice.",

      "customer_reviews": " Hmm...well, sounds like a tele at low volumes...the higher the volume, the worse the squeals;like a pig really...ah well, it's a cheap guitar...also tends to rattle above the 10th fret; on the 1st and 2nd strings (to the point of fretting out completely); and on the 5 and 6 stings on the 1st through 3rd frets...weird...action; settings help, but not much...hard to set the intonation as well (read, damn near impossible)...

      "customer_reviews": "It's got a fatter sound to it than a standard strat for obvious reasons.; I only have a couple complaints. First of all, there's a slight buzzing problem on the sixth string; especially if you're not pressing hard. Also, the strings that came on it were very low quality; On several strings I couldn't even get a note below the 12th fret; but I put Elixirs on it and that's fixed.  ",
